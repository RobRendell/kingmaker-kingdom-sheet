kingmaker-kingdom-sheet
=======================

A javascript-based interactive worksheet for kingdoms in the Pathfinder Kingmaker adventure path.  I was just keeping a local git repo on my laptop, but it became corrupted, so now I want an off-site backup.  If it's of any interest to anyone else, all the better.

I've done all my development using Google Chrome.  If it works in any other browser, that's presumably thanks to jquery, and an added bonus.  We only need it to run in Chrome for our campaign.
